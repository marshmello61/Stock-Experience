# Stock-Experience

# Stock Experience Mod for Moto G5sPlus / May work on other AOSP/LOS based Roms.

This module increases the Default volume of Headphones/LoudSpeakers. 
Do check the version code carefully. The format is VersionCode/*presetlevel**type* where preset level is the level of volume increased, and type is H-Headphones, S-LoudSpeakers.
for example, V1.1/90H. here preset is 90 and H stads for headphone, so this specific module INCREASES THE VOLUME OF HEADPHONES to PRESET 90.

This Particar mod "Stock experience mod" will make your device volume like you were having on stock on moto g5s plus (sanders)



## Caution**
  As i told before use any preset with caution, I will not be responsible for any loss.
  KEEP YOUR VOLUME LOW ALWAYS PLAYING MUSIC FIRST TIME.
